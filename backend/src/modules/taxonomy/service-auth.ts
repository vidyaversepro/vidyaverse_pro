/**
 * Accepts a shared-secret API key on the taxonomy read/tagging endpoints, OR falls
 * through to a normal Vidyaverse admin session.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT the same shape as capabilities' bearer-auth.ts. Capability
 * reads are "what may THIS signed-in user do" — inherently per-user, so an OIDC access
 * token (which names a user) is the right credential. Taxonomy reads are reference
 * data ("what does the tree look like", "what is book X tagged as") with no per-user
 * dimension — the caller is a PDLMS/DCP BACKEND, not a browser holding a user's token.
 * A shared secret is the right credential for a server-to-server reference-data call;
 * inventing a per-user token flow for a request that names no user would be the wrong
 * shape.
 *
 * Vidyaverse's own admin UI reaches the same endpoints too (to render the tagging
 * picker in its book/course integrations), authenticated normally via session cookie
 * — hence the fallback rather than requiring every caller to know the API key.
